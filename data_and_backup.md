# List of Datapools for K4R Platform (Backup)

The persistent data of the k4r platform mainly consists of the content of its databases stored in docker volumes and of the content of Azure blog storages. Additional docker volumes are created by the platform to cache data on the fly or to exchange data between applications. These additional volumes do not have to be included in a backup of the platform. The volumes for the k4r platform databases are:

| Data | Volume | Current Size (dev) | Storage Type | Exportable | Backup needed | Current possible Backup Mechanism
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Entities and Data of the digital twin|data-postgresql-postgresql-0|8 GB|SQL DB (Postgres)|Yes (Using PostgreSQL Export mechanism)|IMPORTANT|SQL Dumps from the postgresql Database or snapshots of the volume  + WAL archiving. See: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/backup.html 
| Entities and Data of the keycloak OAuth Server | data-keycloak-postgresql-0|8 GB|SQL DB (Postgres)|Yes (Using PostgreSQL Export mecanism)|IMPORTANT|SQL Dumps from the postgresql Database or snapshots of the volume  + WAL archiving. See: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/backup.html 
|KnowRob Data|mongodb|8 GB|NoSql DB (Mongo)|Yes|Depends on use case|Mongo Dumps to json/bson file.

Some applications use Azure blob storage to feed data in and out. These is currently data used to visualize objects in the platform applications. Whether there is a need to backup this data depends on the use case. The Azure blob storages currently used by the platform are:  

| Data | Storage Type | Exportable | Backup needed | Current possible Backup Mechanism
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Planograms|Azure Blob Storage|Yes|Depends on use case|Copy data using Azure mechanisms|
|Wireframes|Azure Blob Storage|Yes|Depends on use case|Copy data using Azure mechanisms|

There are some more volumes allocated by the K4R platform. These volumes do not need to be backed up, because their content is restored by the platform itself during operations. These volumes are:

| Data | Volume | Current Size (dev) | Storage Type | Exportable | Backup needed | Current possible Backup Mechanism
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Logging Data|es-logging-master-es-logging-master-0|20 GB|Application specific data|No|UNNECESSARY|n/a
|Logging Data|es-logging-master-es-logging-master-1|20 GB|Application specific data|No|UNNECESSARY|n/a
|Message Queues|data-kafka-0|8 GB|Application specific data|No|UNNECESSARY|n/a
